This paper was done for the purpose of an introductory work placement in an IT company for shipbuilding in the first year of the University of St. Petersburg.

The application is a context menu builder. It allows you to create a hierarchy of parent and child elements, to which you can bind the created parametres.

Features:
1) Creating an infinite number of elements with their own parameters.
2) Creating links between elements.
3) Link visualization in the form of a graphical connection tree (as a node system).
4) Saving as a separate project and loading the already created ones.
5) When saving each project, it also creates an SQL database according to the specified parameters (the main requirement of the IT company for which the application was developed).
